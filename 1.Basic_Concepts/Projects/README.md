# Basic Concepts Projects
This section is to practice the concepts learned in Basic Concepts by creating a project. 

## Project 1: Interactive Calculator
### Concepts: 
* Variables 
* Data types
* Operators
* Control Flow
* Functions<br />

### Description:
Create an interactive calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). 
The calculator should take user input, perform the calculation, and display the result. Use functions to implement the operations and
control flow to handle user inputs.

### Features:
* User-friendly interface for input and output
* Support for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
* Error handling for invalid inputs (e.g. division by zero)

### Additional Challenges:
* Implement a history feature to track and display previous calculations
* Add support for more complex operations (e.g., exponentiation, square root).
